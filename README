Snapshot.app
============

Introduction
------------
Snapshot.app is an application to preview photos on your digital camera and
to download them to your PC. It is based on GNustep and CameraKit, the camera
framework for GNUstep. This application is only tested on Linux/GNUstep.

This application is GPL'ed. Read the COPYING file.
All bugs reports should be sent to Andreas Schik <andreas@schik.de>.


How to build Snapshot.app
-------------------------
o You must install the CameraKit framework first. CameraKit is part of the
  gsimageapps project and is available here: http://home.gna.org/gsimageapps

o You must also have libgphoto2 and its header files on your system. But this
  is required for CameraKit anyway.

o To build Snapshot.app simply do the following:
	make

  Should you get error messages during compilation about the gphoto2 header
  files not being found try this:
	make gphoto2_include=<path_to_the_gphoto2_headers>

o To install Snapshot.app in your global GNUstep directory do:
	make install


Running
-------
To run Snapshot, simply run Snapshot from the command line. The program will
automatically try to detect any connected cameras and will display the cameras
and their directory structure in the outline on the left of the window.
Should you later on add a camera to the system, simply coose the reload command
from the menu.
Snapshot does not need any configuration.
